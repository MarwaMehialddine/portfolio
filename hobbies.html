      <h1 id="h11">Coding</h1>
      <p id="nb11">When I'm coding, I'm always learning and challenging myself due to the non-repeating nature of the task. When I get stuck on a problem for too long, I refer to multiple sources and collect information. I'm training my mind and getting that satisfying feeling when I've finally put all the pieces together.n brief, coding obviously push me outside of your comfort zone, but in a good way! I enjoy it!</p>

    <h1 id="h22">Swimming</h1>
    <p id="nb22">Swimming can be extremely relaxing. I love the feeling of floating on the water and feeling almost weightless. Vitamin D is produced in your skin in response to sun exposure and helps regulate mood, ease anxiety, and ward off depression. It's more fun than other sports. It offers many different strokes, so it doesn’t feel like you’re stuck doing the same thing over and over again. It is an effective way to burn calories.  In the summer, it provides a nice, refreshing break! </p>

      <h1 id="h33">Listening to Music</h1>
      <p id="nb33">Music makes my brain and heart happy. It helps me stop overthinking and just think about the lyrics and melody. I love how it plays with my emotions. It inspires me, makes me weak in my knees, fills me with determination,and makes me cry.When I listen to artists pouring out their hearts,I know that I am not the only one going through this and if they can live through it, so can I.
